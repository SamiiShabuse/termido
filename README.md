# TermiDo — Terminal Productivity Tool in C

A simple C program that combines a:
- 📝 To-Do List Manager (in memory + encrypted file)
- 🔐 File Encryptor using XOR password protection
- 💻 Basic Custom Shell using fork + exec

Built to relearn and master the C programming language from scratch.

## Features
- Add, list, delete, and complete tasks
- Save/load encrypted task list using XOR encryption
- Run terminal commands like `ls`, `pwd`, `echo` via shell mode
- File-based task storage secured with a custom key

## Build & Run

```bash
make
./termido
```

🧠 Git Commit Strategy: I follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) spec to ensure clean versioning, maintainability, and compatibility with automated tooling.
